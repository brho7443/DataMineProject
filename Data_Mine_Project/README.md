## Brief Description

For this project, we aimed to analyze the impact of air quality on various aspects of life for citizens in the United States. Air quality, as established in previous research, is known to have detrimental effects on health, cognitive function, and other vital aspects of daily living. In particular, poor air quality has been linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature death. To better understand these relationships, our team focused on several key areas, including life expectancy, emissions data, causes of death, and respiratory diseases.

We analyzed trends in life expectancy to assess how long-term exposure to poor air quality may be influencing overall health outcomes. By examining emissions data, we were able to understand the sources and levels of pollutants that contribute to poor air quality and their geographical variations. Additionally, we explored cause-of-death statistics to identify any correlations between air pollution and specific health conditions, particularly those related to respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Through these analyses, we sought to uncover the broader societal impacts of air pollution and provide insights into potential areas for intervention.

Ultimately, this project serves as an introduction to understanding the multifaceted effects of air quality on human well-being, highlighting the need for continued research and action to mitigate the risks associated with poor air quality
